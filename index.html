          <h2>Software Engineer</h2>

          <p>
            Hello and welcome to my personal website! My name is Thanh Tran but most people call me Brandon.
            I graduated with the class of 2021 with a degree in Biomedical Engineer from Texas A&M. During my undergrad, 
            I discovered my love of programming. I am particular interested in data science and machine learning has become 
            a fun hobby I partate in. I've also been learning web development and made the website you reading this on right now. 
            I am currently looking for a role as a software developer.  
          </p>

              <p>I took a machine learning course during my senior year and for the final project we were free to do whatever we wished. 
                I wanted to learn more about computer vision, so another classmate and I created a program that would translate the first 5 letters of ALS using a webcam in real-time</p>
