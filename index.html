          <h1>Thanh "Brandon" Tran</h1>
          <h2>Software Engineer</h2>

          <p>
          Hi, I’m Thanh Tran — but most people call me Brandon. I’m a Biomedical Engineering graduate from Texas A&M (Class of 2021) with a passion for both control systems engineering and software development. My journey into programming began in undergrad and has since evolved into hands-on experience in data science, machine learning, and full-stack web development.
          I’m currently seeking roles where I can apply my cross-disciplinary skills to solve real-world problems — whether that’s through automation and control systems or building intelligent software solutions.

              <h3>Reusable Thermo Sterile Indicator</h3>
              <p>I participated in Aggies Invent Vetmed event. My team was tasked with inventing a solution to make disposable sterilization test strips reusable.
                We invented a indicator that would use the metallic properties of thermal expansion that won us 2nd place in the competition.
